On November 10th, 2021, Google [announced](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/update-to-youtube/) that the YouTube dislike count would be removed.  
  
Additionally, the `dislike` field in the YouTube API was [removed](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/134791097/update-to-youtube-dislike-counts) on December 13th, 2021, removing any ability to judge the quality of content before watching.

## This script uses [returnyoutubedislike.com](https://returnyoutubedislike.com/docs) API, to fetch the dislike count from a video.

The code,
```
element_name="Address and search bar"
````
can be changed inorder to work in diffrent web browsers.<br><br>
Vivaldi: `Search or enter an address`<br>
Firefox: `Search with Google or enter address`<br>
Opera: `Address field`<br><br><br><br>
